Same as Asignment two with the addition of:

  (1)

   If a Bank tries to add a duplicate account a DuplicateAccountException must be throw.

   A dupicate account means the same name, same birthdate and same type.

   i.e., it is OK for the same person to have a Savings and Checking account but NOT

   more than 1 Savings or 1 Checking account.

   (2)

    If a transaction will cause an account to have a negative balance an

   OverdrawnAccountException must be thrown.

Look at my main() and the desired output carefully.  You need to deduce the methods

in the exception classes by looking at my main() and output.

Remember, except for white space, your output must match mine to get full credit.
